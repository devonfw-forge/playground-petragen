These projects need to be created in the folder "playground" and need to be each in its own folder (using the project name). 

You need to keep in mind that:

- all projects, all code, must build,
- all Tests in the projects must run successfully and
- you need to have fun

- rust-demo: Parser and Merger implementation in Rust (Rust 2018)

== Cobi and Petra

Petragen is named in honour after Cobi and Petra. 

Cobi was the official mascot of the 1992 Summer Olympics[1] and Petra was the official mascot of the 1992 Summer Paralympics, both held in Barcelona, Spain.

Cobi is a Catalan Sheepdog in Cubist style designed by Javier Mariscal and inspired by the interpretations of Picasso of a masterpiece from Velázquez, Las Meninas. He was unveiled to the public in 1987. His name was derived from the Barcelona Olympic Organising Committee (COOB).

For the Paralympic Games, COOB subsequently requested Mariscal for the creation of a new mascot along the creative lines of Cobi. He created Petra, an armless girl that is to convey positivity, extrovertism, independence, active and bravery.
